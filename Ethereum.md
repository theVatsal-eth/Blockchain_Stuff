# Ether 
A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange secured by a blockchain-based ledger.

**Ether (ETH)** is the cryptocurrency used for many things on the Ethereum network.

**Denominations** : 
- Wei 10e-18 ETH
- Gwei 10e-18 ETH

## Gas
Gas is a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses the more "gas" has to be paid.

Every Transaction that happens on-chain pays a "gas-fee" to node operators.

**Gas**: Measure of computation use.
**Gas Price**: How much it costs per unit of gas.
**Gas Limit**: Max amount of gas in a transaction.
**Transaction Fee**: Gas Used x Gas Price

Gas is charged by denomination of ETH. 

Gas price is based off the "demand" of the blockchain. The more people want too make transactions, the higher gas price, and therefore the higher the transaction fees. This limits the no. of people that can join the network and use it effectively and efficiently because of high gas prices involved.

Ethereum follows **EIP 1559** as transaction pricing mechanism.

## [[Eth2]]
The Ethereum is shifting to Eth2 so as to reduce the enviromental impact it has due to [[Consensus#Proof Of Work]], thus implementing [[Consensus#Proof Of Stake]].

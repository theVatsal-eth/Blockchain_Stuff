# Enginnering Smart Contracts
While engineering [[Smart Contracts]] we test our code. So we use test networks to deploy our codes and see if it runs.
These test networks are exactly like Ethereum Mainnet but they don't have real money and it won't affect the real network.

Testnets are free and for testing smart contracts. Mainnet cost money and are considered "live".

We are using Rinkeby Testnet for now.

## Making first transaction 
**Faucet** - Is an application that gives us free test tokens, like free test Rinkeby Ethereum.

# Blockchain
Blockchain is a system of chained blocks linked through hashes. Each block contains a **Block no., Nonce, Data, Previous hash, Hash**. Blockhain is a very sercure network which stays isolated from the outer world.

A blockchain is a public database that is updated and shared across many computers in a network.

"Block" refers to data and state being stored in consecutive groups known as "blocks". If you send ETH to someone else, the transaction data needs to be added to a block to be successful.

"Chain" refers to the fact that each block cryptographically references its parent. In other words, blocks get chained together. The data in a block cannot change without changing all subsequent blocks, which would require the consensus of the entire network.

Every computer in the network must agree upon each new block and the chain as a whole. These computers are known as "nodes". Nodes ensure everyone interacting with the blockchain has the same data. To accomplish this distributed agreement, blockchains need a consensus mechanism.

[[Ethereum]] is one of the best blockchains, which allows [[Smart Contracts]], on its network. Also Ethereum Protocol is Turing complete network.

## Features of Blockchains
- **Decentralised** - No centralised source controls the network. RUn by network of individuals.
- **Transparency & Flexibility** - Everything that happens on-chain is transparent.
- **Speed & Efficiency** - Settlements are easy as everything is math based.
- **Security & Immutability**
- **Removal of counterparty risk**
- **Trustless System** -  No trust is required as everything things is mathematically designed.
- **Hybrid Smart Contracts**
